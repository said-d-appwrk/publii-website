This kind of message can interrupt ExcelPipe's processing, so you can force ExcelPipe to restart Microsoft Excel after a given number of seconds of inactivity.</p>\n<p>A value of 0 disables this option, 30 seconds is a useful default.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h3>Location of EXCEL.EXE (to restart from catastrophic failures)</h3>\n<p>Sometimes when Microsoft Excel is restarted it corrupts its own settings in the System Registry, making it impossible to restart using normal methods. By specifying the path to Microsoft Excel, you can get ExcelPipe to attempt to restart Microsoft Excel directly. Use the browse button to locate EXCEL.EXE, possibly in C:\\Program Files\\Microsoft Office\\OFFICE11\\EXCEL.EXE.</p>",

If the original file was called test.xls, the backup is saved to test.bak.</p>\n<h2>Retain file Modified dates</h2>\n<p>When checked, the original file date of files is retained.</p>\n<h2>Retain file Last Access dates</h2>\n<p>When checked, the original Last Accessed date of files is retained. This allows your organization's data retention policy to be maintained, as documents that have not been accessed by a human still retain their original date.</p>\n<h2>Allow alerts (necessary for mail merge)</h2>\n<p>Normally ExcelPipe disables alerts from Microsoft Excel, which is fine in most cases as the default choice is selected.</p>\n<h2>Process longest 'Find what' strings first</h2>\n<p>Very useful for translators, this option causes the search/replace list to be first sorted in order of the longest (i.e. most specific) Find What strings first. A good example is this:</p>\n<table id=\"table1\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>No.</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Find What - English</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Replace with - Spanish translation</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1.</td>\n<td>Parent</td>\n<td>Padre</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2.</td>\n<td>Parent Information</td>\n<td>Information sobre los padres</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>If the string 'Parent Information' is found in the file, it gets replaced by 'Padre Information', and the second row is never used. This situation is avoided by first sorting the list so that the longest (i.e. most specific) replacements are first.</p>\n<h2>Process read only files</h2>\n<p>When checked, if read-only files are encountered, they are first changed to read-write, processed, and then set back to read-only status. When unchecked, read-only files are skipped.</p>\n<h2>Process hidden rows and columns</h2>\n<p>By default, hidden rows and columns are not searched. Check this option to search them -&gt; this can be slightly slower.</p>\n<h2>Keep Microsoft Excel visible while changes are being made</h2>\n<p>While slower, this option can be useful for debugging and monitoring what ExcelPipe is doing.</p>\n<h2>Accept Revisions</h2>\n<p>Accepts revisions before processing - otherwise they can prevent matches from being found.</p>\n<h2>Disable Addins</h2>\n<p>Checked by default, this option disables Microsoft Excel AddIns in case they interfere with the search/replace process. If you need an AddIn to remain loaded then uncheck this box.</p>\n<h2>Prevent overlap of search/replaces</h2>\n<p>Prevent chaining of search/replaces where a early replace gets changed by a subsequent search e.g. with the following set of replacements:</p>\n<table id=\"table2\" border=\"1\" width=\"228\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"27\"><strong>Line</strong></td>\n<td width=\"86\"><strong>Search for</strong></td>\n<td width=\"93\"><strong>Replace with</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"27\">1</td>\n<td width=\"86\">cat</td>\n<td width=\"93\">dog</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"27\">2</td>\n<td width=\"86\">dog</td>\n<td width=\"93\">rat</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"27\">3</td>\n<td width=\"86\">rat</td>\n<td width=\"93\">foo</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Imagine the sentence 'A cat bit the dog'. This will be changed to 'A foo bit the foo' because the replacement on one line is found by the search on the next line.</p>\n<p>When this option is checked, the replacement becomes 'A dog bit the rat'.</p>\n<h2>Password for open</h2>\n<p>If a document requires a password for open, ExcelPipe will open it using this password. The password is ignored if it is not required to open the document. If the password is wrong the document is skipped.</p>\n<p>This can be handy if you have multiple password-protected documents sharing the same protection password.</p>\n<h2>Password to unprotect sheet/workbook</h2>\n<p>If a sheet or workbook requires a password to modify it, ExcelPipe will provide this password. The password is ignored if not required.</p>\n<p>This password is also used if you specify a Code Module search and a VBProject is found to be protected.</p>\n<p>ExcelPipe restores the original protection when it saves the file.</p>\n<h2>ISO-9001 version control</h2>\n<p>If your company is certified to the international ISO-9001 standard, it's essential that you also update each document's version number when any changes are made.</p>\n<p>With ExcelPipe, you can automatically update the version number by 1.0 or 0.1 or any other amount automatically.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h3>'Revision' document property name</h3>\n<p>This is the name of the custom property that holds the version number in the document, usually 'DocRevision' or similar. For more information, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.datamystic.com/wordpipe/document_versions.html\" rel=\"noopener\">please click here.</a> This field is NOT case-sensitive.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h3>Increment</h3>\n<p>The amount to increment the revision by, usually 1.0 or 0.1. This value must be a valid floating-point number.</p>",

Click the [Add] button to add a new row to the end of the grid. To delete rows, first select them and then click [Delete]. To edit a row, click it, and then press [F2], or click the cell a second time. You can [Tab] and [Shift-Tab] through the grid. You can change the search settings for multiple rows simultaneously by first selecting them and then changing the search settings below. You can move rows using drag and drop. Copy rows by selecting them and then clicking [Copy]. Clear All rows by clicking [Clear All].</p>\n<h2>Find what</h2>\n<p>Type the information you want to search for or paste it from the Clipboard. The Find text is limited by Microsoft Excel to be a maximum length of 255 characters. You can right click this field for a popup menu with Cut, Copy, Paste and Clear commands.</p>\n<p>You can search for more than one line of text at a time. If you use the wildcards *, ? or ~ in your Find What string, see the <a href=\"special.htm\">special characters section</a>.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Searching for multiple lines</strong></p>\n<p>Although the edit field can hold multiple lines of text, Microsoft Excel does NOT allow you to search for multiple lines at once (and ExcelPipe cannot get around this limitation). The best way to search for multiple lines is to break them up into several line-by-line or phrase-by-phrase searches.</p>\n<h3> </h3>\n<h3>Replacing Images</h3>\n<p>First set the <strong>Find What </strong>text to</p>\n<p>    ^g</p>\n<p>ie literally carat (Shift+6) followed by letter 'g'. Not Ctrl+G. (Astute users will notice that this is the same as with MS Word)</p>\n<p>Set the <strong>Replace With</strong> field to the complete path to the replacement image on disk.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Replace with</h2>\n<p>Type the text that you want to use as replacement text or paste if from the Clipboard. Leave the Replace With box empty to delete the Find What box from your document. You can right click this field for a popup menu with Cut, Copy, Paste and Clear commands.</p>\n<p>The <strong>Replace With </strong>text can include <a href=\"special.htm\">Macros</a> such as @filename@.</p>\n<h2>Search Type</h2>\n<h3>Normal search</h3>\n<p>Matches the text exactly as written.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h3>EasyPattern wildcards</h3>\n<p>Important Note: This search type does <strong>NOT </strong>apply to the <i>Cells</i> search location. For wildcard searches in <i>Cells</i>, use Microsoft Excel's inbuilt <a href=\"special.htm\">wildcards</a>, with the <strong>Search Type</strong> set to 'Normal search'.</p>\n<p>An EasyPattern allows you to search for a class of text strings rather than specifying every single possibility. For example, to search for a dollar sign followed by a currency amount:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>$[ capture(1+ digits, period, 2 digits) ]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Replace With:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>USD $1</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Click here for the <a href=\"easypatterns_basics.html\">EasyPattern basics</a> and <a href=\"easypatterns_reference.html\">reference</a>.</p>\n<p>EasyPatterns are easier to learn and use than perl regex patterns, but to use them in other packages you need to use EasyPattern Helper to convert them to perl regex.</p>\n<h3> </h3>\n<h3>Perl regex wildcards</h3>\n<p>Important Note: This search type does <strong>NOT </strong>apply to the <i>Cells</i> search location. For wildcard searches in <i>Cells</i>, use Microsoft Excel's inbuilt <a href=\"special.htm\">wildcards</a>, with the <strong>Search Type</strong> set to 'Normal search'.</p>\n<p>A perl regex pattern allows you to search for a class of text strings rather than specifying every single possibility. For example, to search for a dollar sign followed by a currency amount:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\\$(\\d+\\.\\d{2})</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Replace With:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>USD $1</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Click here for the <a href=\"perl_regular_expressions.htm\">Perl regex reference</a>.</p>\n<p>Perl regex patterns are harder to learn and use than EasyPatterns, but they are support by a huge range of applications.</p>\n<h2>Look In (Search location)</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Cells - look in each cell</li>\n<li>Hyperlink addresses (*) - look inside hyperlink addresses. To change the displayed text, use the 'Cells' option above as well</li>\n<li>Shapes/Shapes and Text Boxes (*) - inside the text of shapes and grouped shapes and text boxes</li>\n<li>Headers (*) - search inside the left, centre and right header of each sheet</li>\n<li>Footers (*) - search inside the left, centre and right footer of each sheet</li>\n<li>Built in properties (*) - inside Subject, Title, Author etc fields</li>\n<li>Custom properties (*) - inside custom properties defined by the user</li>\n<li>Links (OLE and DDE) (*) - inside links to external documents and databases, and the connection strings of Query Tables and Pivot Tables - ADO, DAO, OLEDB and ODBC database queries, Web queries etc.</li>\n<li>Chart Titles (*) - inside the titles of charts. Note - axis labels come from the work sheet itself, so use the Cells option to replace them</li>\n<li>Defined Names (*) - search and replace the name and the value of predefined names (the names of ranges, constants etc)</li>\n<li>Code Modules (*) - search and replace code modules. If the modules are password-protected, enter this password on the <a href=\"options.htm\">Options tab</a>, <i>Password to Unprotect</i> field. See <a href=\"code-modules-security.html\">code modules security</a>.</li>\n<li>Sheet Names (*) - search inside sheet names e.g. Sheet1, Sheet2, Sheet3</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Items with (*) support the use of EasyPatterns and Perl regex patterns.</p>\n<h3> </h3>\n<h3>Hyperlink addresses</h3>\n<p>If you want to change the displayed text (not the hyperlink itself), please use a Cells Search instead of, or in addition to this option. This option can be used to search and replace hyperlinks to update server names, UNC paths etc. We recommend that the Match Case option be unchecked, so that both upper case and lower case data can be found. You can use any search type, including EasyPatterns and Perl regex patterns.</p>\n<p>If the hyperlink address and display text are identical they will be updated simultaneously. ExcelPipe treats the two representations of space (' ' and '%20') as equivalent, however other escaped characters (in %XX form) need to be handle manually.</p>\n<p>Note also that sometimes the display text of a hyperlink is completely different to the actual link. To be sure that what you are replacing is correct, right click on the hyperlink in Excel and choose 'Edit Hyperlink'. You may have to perform one search for the display text and another search for the hyperlink text.</p>\n<h3> </h3>\n<h3>Searching in Built In and Custom Properties</h3>\n<p>By default a search/replace will search ALL properties.</p>\n<p>To specify a particular property, prefix the search string with the property name in square brackets [ .. ] e.g</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[Author]Simon</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>replaces the word 'Simon' only in the [Author] field.</p>\n<h2>Match case</h2>\n<p>Distinguishes between UPPERCASE and lowercase letters. When Match Case is selected, ExcelPipe finds only those instances in which the capitalization matches the text you typed in the Find What box.</p>\n<h2>Match entire cell contents</h2>\n<p>Searches for matches where the entire cell has this value, rather than part of the cell.</p>\n<h2>Prompt</h2>\n<p>When checked, displays the found text and asks for confirmation before replacing it.</p>\n<p>You can choose to Replace or Skip just one, the remainder in the current file, or the remainder for the whole job.</p>\n<p>Note: Prompting is not supported for every <i>Look In</i> location.</p>\n<h3>Skip Prompt if Identical</h3>\n<p>If the search text is identical after replacing it, then skip showing the prompt. This can be very useful when using pattern matching which may not alter the text.</p>\n<h2>Highlight replacement</h2>\n<p>Where possible, the replaced text is highlighted to make it easier to find. If you use Microsoft Excel 2003 or earlier, the highlight color can only be one of 56 standard colors, so the color you choose is automatically matched to the closest available color.</p>\n<h2>Match half/full width forms</h2>\n<p>When checked, Unicode (double-byte) characters match only Unicode (double-byte) characters. When unchecked, Unicode (double-byte) characters match their ANSI (single-byte) equivalents.</p>\n<p>You can use this argument only if you've selected or installed double-byte language support in Microsoft Excel, such as for Japanese.</p>\n<h2>Use this search/replace list</h2>\n<p>When checked, search/replace pairs are loaded from a file dynamically at run time - from Excel (.XLS files), Comma Separated Value (.CSV files) or Tab-delimited (.TAB files) formats. The current search type, search location and other options are used for every search/replace pair added. A list can also be imported using an option in the Options menu.</p>\n<p>For the complete file format details, <a href=\"../menus/options.htm\">please click here</a>. You can find sample import files in the <strong>Samples</strong> folder (in .tab, .csv and .xls format).</p>\n<p>ExcelPipe can handle an unlimited number of replacements - but Microsoft Excel is limited to 65534 rows of data. You can work around this limit by loading multiple files from the <a href=\"../command%20line%20parameters.htm\">command line</a>. Note - despite Microsoft Excel 2007 and later being able to handle 1 million rows, it is unable to provide data beyond 65535 rows to ExcelPipe. To work around this, save your Microsoft Excel data to a .CSV or .TAB temporary file so that ExcelPipe can import all the data.</p>\n<p>Note: Loading large lists from Excel is very slow - export your list to .CSV or .TAB and then import that instead.</p>",
